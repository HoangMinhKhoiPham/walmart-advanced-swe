# Walmart Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience

Welcome to the Walmart Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience! This repository contains solutions to the tasks provided as part of the virtual experience, demonstrating proficiency in various areas of software engineering.

## Overview

Walmart's Shipping Department is undergoing significant enhancements, and as part of this virtual experience, you'll tackle four distinct challenges:

1. **Advanced Data Structures:** Implement a modified version of a heap data structure optimized for performance.
   
2. **Software Architecture:** Design a flexible and extensible data processing pipeline capable of handling various modes and databases.

3. **Relational Database Design:** Develop an appropriately normalized relational database schema to consolidate Walmart's pet department data.

4. **Data Munging:** Populate a SQLite database with shipping data from disparate spreadsheets using Python scripting.

## Project Structure

- **Task 1:** Contains the Java implementation of the "power of two max heap" data structure.
- **Task 2:** Includes the UML class diagram for the data processor and its implementation.
- **Task 3:** Presents the ERD design for the relational database and its implementation.
- **Task 4:** Provides the Python script for data munging and loading into the SQLite database.
